# Sublime-Terminus
To Bind Terminus to open using "ctrl + ~"  and "ctrl  + t "



When we first install Sublime, it does not come with Terminus. Even more so, the key-binding "ctrl + ~" does not open with any real prompt. 


Coming from editors like VScode etc where ctrl + ~ open the terminal leaves the desire for the same in sublime as well. 


Following are the steps for getting this key-binding working for sublime-text3

1. Using Package Control, Install Terminus. 
2. If you don't have package control , then install that first. 

3. Go to Preferences -> Package Settings -> Terminux -> Key Bindings 

4. Copy Paste the contents of the given bindings.txt into the right side pane of the file that opens. 

5. If need be, restart Sublime. The new key bindings will work.
